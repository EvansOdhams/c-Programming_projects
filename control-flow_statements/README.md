To get started with these projects, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have a C compiler installed, we recommend installing GCC, which is a popular and widely-used C compiler.

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can clone or download this directory to your local machine and run the projects using a terminal or command prompt. Refer to the individual project README files for specific instructions.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this directory! If you have a project you'd like to contribute, please create a new project directory with its own README file and submit a pull request with your changes.
