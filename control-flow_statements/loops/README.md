Do_While Loop
Task 1:
How can we use a do-while loop in C to create a program that continuously prompts the user to enter a positive integer, and calculates the sum of all the positive integers entered until the user enters a negative integer?

Pseudocode 
1. Initialize sum to 0
2. Repeat the following steps:
3.     Prompt the user to enter a positive integer
4.     Read the input integer n from the user
5.     if n < 0 then
6.         Exit the loop
7.     end if
8.     Add n to sum
9. End repeat
10. Display the sum to the user
